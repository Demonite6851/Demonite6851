This is my profile. It has some cool things on it.<br>
I am 16 and am currently enrolled at Nora Frances Henderson Secondary School.<br>
I am moderately skilled in Python and am slightly skilled in Javascript and HTML.<br>
I am also a bit good at making things in the Unity game engine, but I am not that good at coding them.<br>
I am currently looking to expand my knowledge on Unity code, Python, Javascript, and HTML as well as learn how to code in C#.<br>
I've made several projects in HTML and Python, which you can find inside their respective repositories.
